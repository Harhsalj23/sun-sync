# Sun Sync
Imagine a sunflower that always keeps its face directly towards the sun. A dual-axis solar tracker is like a giant, automated sunflower for solar panels.

It uses motors to tilt and turn the panels on two axes, following the sun as it moves across the sky throughout the day. This way, the panels get the most sunlight possible, which means they can generate more electricity.
